## Thanks

This is derivative work from [Drop Python](https://hugovk.github.io/drop-python/), a site that tracks progress of packages dropping old (EOL) python versions. 
Thanks also to [Python Wheels](https://pythonwheels.com), a site that tracks progress in the new Python package distribution standard called [Wheels](https://pypi.org/project/wheel), [Python 3 Wall of Superpowers](https://python3wos.appspot.com/) for the concept and making their code open source, and see also [Python 3 Readiness](http://py3readiness.org).
